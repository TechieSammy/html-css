    <h1> In Places where neither cream nor condensed milk can be purchased, a fair ice cream is made by adding two tablespoonfuls of olive oil to each quartof milk. The Cream should be rather rich, but not double cream.
    <h1/>
    <nav>If pure raw cream is stirred rapidly, it swells and become forthy, like the beaten whites of eggs, and is "whipped cream". To prevent this in making Philadepia Ice Cream, one-half the cream is scalded, and when it is very cold, the remainig half of the raw cream is added.This gives the smooth, light and rich consistency which makes these creams so different from others. </nav>
    <span>The time for freezing varies according to the quality of cream or milk or water; water ices require a longer time than ice creams. It is not wellto freeze the mixtures too rapidly; they are apt to be coarse,not smooth,and if they are churned before the mixture is icy cold they will be greasy or  "buttery"</span>
